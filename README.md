# dotfiles
Hello this is my personal dotfiles, tho it's very much copied from another user.

# Icefrost tokyo night theme instructions:

Put the "icons" folder in ".local/share/icons/"

On the ".config" file you need to put the inside of the folder, so you need to copy the contents inside then paste them to your .config folder located in ur home directory.

To install the themes, you need to copy the "TokyoNight" file on your ".themes" folder located in '/usr/share.themes'

To install oh-my-bash type this commands via curl:sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmybash/oh-my-bash/master/tools/install.sh)", then after you should be good to go.

And finally put ur ".bashrc" on ur home directory.
